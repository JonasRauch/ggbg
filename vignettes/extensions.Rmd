## Introduction

I wrote this document while figuring out how to write my own custom geoms for
`ggplot`.  The existing documentation available through `?Geom` and
`browseVignettes('ggplot2')` was a great starting point for me, but I found
myself wanting more context and details than it provides.

This is unofficial documentation based on my interpretation of the sources as of
~4/18/2018.  It may become out-of-date as `ggplot2` evolves.

This document assumes the reader is familiar with how to use `ggplot2` for
plotting purposes.


## Ggplot Basics - an Extension Developer Perspective

### It's The Printing, Stupid

In order to create and display a `ggplot` plot we go through two major steps:

1. Specification (`ggplot() + ...`): user specifies what the plot
   should look like with `geom_*`, `stat_*`, `scale_*`, etc..
2. Generation and rendering, typically triggered by printing a `ggplot`
   object.

As a `ggplot` user you are mostly concerned with 1.  As a `ggplot` extension
developer, you are also concerned with the plot generation step.  This is
were `ggplot` does most of the work.  You can look at `ggplot2:::print.ggplot`
to see the major steps involved, which can be summarized as:

1. Build (`ggplot_build`): analyzes and transforms data into a format suited for
   translation into graphical objects:
    1. Assigns facet panels.
    2. Computes aesthetic values from data and `aes(...)` specifications.
    3. Assigns groups.
    4. Rescales data if non linear scales are specified.
    5. Computes and maps statistics.
    6. Transforms special aesthetics (e.g. `width` to `xmin`-`xmax`).
    7. Adjusts positions (e.g. dodging/stacking with `$compute_positions`).
    8. Recompute scales.
    9. Adds default aesthetics as needed.
2. Graphical Object Construction (`ggplot_gtable`):
    1. Applies coordinate transformations (if necessary)
    2. Translate the data into shapes, colors, positions, etc.
3. Rendering (`grid.draw`): display the resulting plot in a viewport.

The plot
generation step triggered by `print.ggplot` can be broken into:



## Alternate Docs

### On `gg_proto`

Things to know:

* Objects that contain member functions and data
* The members can be accessed like list objects `object$member`
* When member functions are invoked they are always automatically provided with
  a `self` object if `self` is part of the signature (you can probably still
  access `self` even if it isn't in the sig, need to test).

### Ggplot Basics

### Mapping


### Rendering



Extending `ggplot` requires influencing how steps 1. and 2. are carried out.
This is done by creating layer functions (e.g. `geom_*` or `stat_*`) functions that return layers containing custom `Geom*` or `Stat*` objects.



```
 ## For reference, `sys.calls()` from a debugged `setup_data`:
 $ : language function (x, ...)  UseMethod("print")(x)
 $ : language print.ggplot(x)
 $ : language ggplot_build(x)
 $ : language by_layer(function(l, d) l$compute_geom_1(d))
 $ : language f(l = layers[[i]], d = data[[i]])
 $ : language l$compute_geom_1(d)
 $ : language f(..., self = self)
 $ : language self$geom$setup_data(data, c(self$geom_params, self$aes_params))
 $ : language f(...)
```

### Geom Basics

To implement a geom you need:

* A `geom_*` standard function
* A `Geom*` object, possibly re-used from an existing geom

### The `Geom*` Object

`Geom*` objects such as `GeomPoint` or `GeomRect` are responsible for
translating your data into graphical objects.  In `ggplot` these graphical
objects are called "grobs", short for Grid Graphical Objects, because they are
encoded in a format defined by the `grid` R package.  In order to create your
own geoms you will need to learn how to use `grid`, or alternatively to re-use
existing `Geom*` objects to generate grobs suited for your purposes.  For
example in this package we re-use `GeomRect` for `GeomWaterfall`.

`Geom*` objects are implemented using `ggproto`, a `ggplot2` specific Object
Oriented framework.  `ggproto` is derived from the `proto` R OOP package.



## Extending Ggplot 2 vignette

### What `ggplot2` Does

### Creating Geoms

The `setup_data` and `draw_panel` functions we referenced above are part of the
`Geom*` `ggproto` objects.

`setup_data` is used to convert parameters / aesthetics that are not in a format
amenable to plotting, to one that is.  One prime example is converting `width`
and `height` to `xmin/xmax` and `ymin/ymax` values.


In "Creating a new Geom", `draw_panel` is described as having 3 parameters,
instead of the 4 + (in particular starting with `self`) in other docs and in the
source.  Additionally, the `panel_scales` param appears to actually be
`panel_params`, at least in the sample fun we used (but `?Geom` also references
`panel_scales`).

For `draw_panel` sigs, we have

* `GeomPoint`: `function(data, panel_params, coord, na.rm = FALSE)`
* `GeomRect`: `function(self, data, panel_params, coord)`
* `Geom`: `function(self, data, panel_params, coord, ...)`

From what I can infer from docs and source your function must accept at least
three arguments.  `draw_layer` from `Geom` will call `draw_panel` with three
unnamed parameters that in theory should match up to `data`, `panel_params`,
`coord`.

* `data`: A data.frame with all the aesthetic values as specified via `aes`.
  The column names corresponding to the aesthetic names, not the original data
  frame column names.  Additionally contains `PANEL`, `group` (set to -1 if
  there are no groups), and any default aesthetics specified in
  `Geom*$default_aes`.
* `panel_params`: named list, the intersection of parameters provided to the
  `geom_*` function with the formals of the `draw_panel` method, although you
  can customize `Geom` objects to return a specific eligible parameter list.
* `coord`: coord transformation functions?

Additionally, named parameters that are the intersection of the parameters
provided to the `geom_*` function by the user and the parameters of `draw_panel`
are supplied.

Finally, since `draw_panel` is a `ggproto` method `self` will be provided if it
is part of the `draw_panel` signature.

### `setup_data` vs `reparametrise`

It seems like both those functions can be used for the same purpose.  For
example, in `GeomRect`, `setup_data` is explicitly used to convert width to
`xmax/xmin`.

Actually, looks like `reparameterise` doesn't exist anymore?
